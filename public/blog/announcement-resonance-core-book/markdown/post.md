Today marks an important milestone for Fluxline Resonance Group — and for me personally. After months of research, testing, refinement, and lived application, I'm excited to share the first public preview of **The Resonance Core Framework™**, a system designed to help people create meaningful, aligned, and sustainable change in their lives.

This framework didn't begin as a business initiative. It began as a necessity.

## Why This Framework Exists

At its core, the RCF is based on a simple truth:

**People make their best decisions when they act in alignment with who they are.**

Not who they're told to be. Not who they think they "should" be. But who they actually are — in identity, values, emotion, logic, and lived experience.

## What Comes Next

Over the coming months, I'll be sharing more previews, behind-the-scenes development, insights from the framework, and updates on the book and workbook.
