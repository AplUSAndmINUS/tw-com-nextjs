# **When My Rhythms Broke — And How I'm Learning to Trust Them Again**

_TW.com — Personal Essay_

There's a version of me that used to feel effortless.  
A version that woke up early, trained consistently, created with clarity, and moved through the day with a kind of quiet internal rhythm — not perfect, but coherent. A version that felt like it was in conversation with the world instead of fighting it.

And then, slowly, that rhythm broke.

Not all at once.  
Not dramatically.  
Just… drift.

A late night here.  
A missed morning there.  
A few days of fog.  
A few weeks of "I'll fix it tomorrow."  
And then suddenly I was living in a body that didn't feel like mine — sleeping at the wrong times, waking up exhausted, chasing energy instead of generating it.

People talk about "losing momentum."  
But what I lost was **my rhythm**.

And for someone like me — someone whose mental health depends on structure, light, timing, and consistency — that disruption wasn't just inconvenient. It was destabilizing.

I felt like I was living out of phase with myself.

## **The Drift Is Subtle Until It Isn't**

When my sleep started slipping, I told myself it was temporary.  
A busy week.  
A stressful month.  
A creative sprint.  
A little insomnia.

But circadian drift is sneaky.  
It doesn't ask permission.  
It just shifts you one degree at a time until you're suddenly living three hours off your natural axis.

And once you're off‑rhythm, everything else starts to wobble:

- Mood
- Focus
- Appetite
- Training
- Creativity
- Emotional regulation
- Sense of self

It's like your internal metronome starts clicking at the wrong tempo, and no matter how hard you try, you can't sync up with the beat.

I knew I needed to rebuild my rhythm — not with force, not with guilt, but with patience.

## **Retraining My Rhythm (Gently, This Time)**

I used to think fixing my sleep meant "go to bed earlier."  
But that's not how bodies work — especially not mine.

So I started with the only anchor that matters: **wake time**.

I set my lights to start rising at 7am.  
I committed to waking at 8am, even if I felt groggy.  
I stopped trying to force sleep and started creating the conditions for it.  
I built a day that supported the night instead of fighting it.

And slowly — almost imperceptibly — my rhythm began to return.

Not perfectly.  
Not linearly.  
But rhythmically.

Some days I wake up before the lights.  
Some days I drag myself out of bed.  
Some days I feel aligned.  
Some days I feel like I'm still learning how to be human.

But the difference now is that I'm not trying to dominate my rhythm.  
I'm partnering with it.

## **The Truth I'm Learning**

My body isn't a machine.  
It's not programmable.  
It's not obedient.  
It's not something to conquer.

It's rhythmic.  
Cyclical.  
Responsive.  
Alive.

And when I treat it like a living system instead of a broken one, it responds with a kind of quiet loyalty. It starts to trust me again. It starts to show up for me again.

I'm not "fixed."  
I'm not "optimized."  
I'm not "perfectly aligned."

I'm just… listening.  
And that's enough.

## **Where I Am Now**

I'm retraining my rhythm one morning at a time.  
One light cue at a time.  
One consistent wake‑up at a time.  
One gentle adjustment at a time.

I'm learning that rhythm isn't something you force.  
It's something you cultivate.

And maybe that's the real work — not becoming a perfectly regulated human, but becoming someone who honors the cycles that make me who I am.

Someone who doesn't fight the drift, but notices it.  
Someone who doesn't shame the disruption, but responds to it.  
Someone who doesn't demand perfection, but builds rhythm.

This is the version of me I'm rebuilding.  
Not the old one.  
A new one — steadier, softer, more attuned.

A version that trusts the beat of my own life again.
