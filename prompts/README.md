# Prompts Log

This folder contains a log of all AI-assisted development prompts used in the TW.com Next.js project.

## Purpose

Since this project is primarily AI-driven with @Aplusandminus directing architecture and front-end build, all Copilot/AI prompts should be logged here for visibility and reproducibility.

## Format

Create a new file for each session or feature, named with the date and topic:

```
YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md
```

## Index

| Date | Topic | File |
|------|-------|------|
| — | — | *(none yet — add entries as prompts are logged)* |
